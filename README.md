## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

As seen below, linear regression function and summary was ran within R Studio with six variables passed in: MPG, vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD. Of these six variables, vehicle weight, vehicle length, and ground clearance showed a p value of 0. This means that they provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values and are significant.

Our analysis also shows the lm slope to be 5.35e-11 and an r-squared value of 0.71. A non-zero slope means that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. The r-squared value shows that 71% of the MPG varience comes from the independent variables and that the model effectively predicts MPG of MechaCar prototypes.
